# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description 

This website provides a daily task scheduler for the average 9 to 5 work period, blocking off each hour and illuminating the current hour, while graying out past hours. The time is checked every ten minutes in case the scheduler is left open in the browser so that the user can be alerted of the current hour's tasks without any extra effort.
